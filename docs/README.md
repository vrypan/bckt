# bckt3 Theme Documentation

This directory collects theme-specific guides and reference material. Start
here when customising the theme or integrating new features.

## Contents
- [Pages Directory](pages.md) — how `pages/` files are rendered and how to build
  standalone pages.
- [Templates Overview](templates.md) — anatomy of the core MiniJinja templates
  and the context they receive.
- [Static Assets](static-assets.md) — managing files under `skel/`.
- [Custom Filters](custom_filters.md) — MiniJinja helpers such as `format_date`.
- [Search Integration](search.md) — requirements and implementation notes for
  the client-side search feature.

Add new documents here as additional theme features are introduced.
